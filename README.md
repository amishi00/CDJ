# Sentiment Analysis on Professor Reviews

## What it does
As a part of Cornell Data Journal (CDJ), we were tasked with finding how professor reviews vary across different years, departments, genders, and colleges within Cornell. To conduct this analysis, we needed to webscrape data from websites such as 'Rate My Professor' and 'CUReviews' from the past years. After scraping data, we needed to put the reviews in an algorithm which identified them as negative or positive. Therefore, this algorithm was created to take in data in the form of a CSV file and conduct positive/negative sentiment analysis on it using Natual Language Toolkit (NLTK). 

## Collaboration/Feedback
As with all NLP models, this one is not perfect and might misinterpret the sentiments based on the words literal meaning. Therefore, we are always looking for ways to improve the algorithm and provide a more accurate result.
